# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **Multi-session display** — Up to 4 concurrent Claude Code sessions rendered as individual Clawd sprites with per-session animations. Protocol v2 `set_sessions` action sends per-session animation state and stable UUIDs. Overflow badge shows "+N" when sessions exceed `MAX_VISIBLE=4`.

- **Walk-in animation** — New sessions enter from offscreen with a walking sprite animation. Existing sessions reposition with walk animations when the layout changes.

- **Going-away burrowing animation** — Sessions that exit play a burrowing animation instead of a fade-out. Remaining sessions defer repositioning until the burrowing completes.

- **HUD subagent counter** — Mini-crab icon with pixel-art bitmap font shows active subagent count. Session overflow badge anchored to container right edge.
  ![HUD subagents](assets/sim-recordings/clawd-hud-subagents.gif)
- **Per-session sweeping** — `PreCompact` events now send a sweep animation only to the compacting session (v2), instead of a global sweep (v1 fallback preserved).

- **Protocol version negotiation** — BLE GATT characteristic exposes protocol version (v2). Daemon reads it on connect and selects v1 `set_status` or v2 `set_sessions` payloads per-transport.
- **`query_state` TCP action** — Debug introspection command returns JSON with all slot states, animations, and positions.
- **`gemini_animate.py` tool** — AI-assisted SVG animation generation using Gemini API.
- **New sprite assets** — Going-away burrowing sprite, walking sprite, mini-clawd HUD sprite, with SVG sources.
- **Auto-crop sprite pipeline** — `tools/crop_sprites.py` crops all sprite headers in-place with symmetric horizontal padding (keeps Clawd centered) and free vertical cropping. Reduces frame buffer memory by 69% (1194 KB → 368 KB across all sprites). `tools/analyze_sprite_bounds.py` for bounding box analysis.
- **RGB565A8 pixel format on firmware** — Frame buffers use 3 bytes/pixel (native-with-alpha for 16-bit display) instead of 4 bytes/pixel ARGB8888, saving 25% memory per buffer. New `rle_decode_rgb565a8` decoder in `rle_sprite.h`.
- **Heap diagnostics** — Free heap breakdown (internal SRAM + PSRAM) logged at firmware boot.
- **OOM logging** — Frame buffer allocation failures logged with `ESP_LOGW` instead of silent skip.
- **Custom app icon** — New macOS app icon with Clawd pixel-art crab design, replacing the default py2app icon. SVG source and full iconset included in `assets/`.

### Changed

- **Scene slot architecture** — `MAX_VISIBLE=4` on both platforms. `MAX_SLOTS=6` on firmware (no PSRAM), `MAX_SLOTS=8` on simulator.
- **Sprite dimensions** — All sprites auto-cropped to tight bounding boxes. Largest session sprite is confused at 152x113 (was 180x180). Idle is 72x51, walking is 60x40. y_offsets adjusted to preserve on-screen positioning.
- **`build.sh` always rebuilds** — No stale check; static simulator is always rebuilt to avoid version drift.

### Fixed

- **Firmware build errors** — Fixed `pixel_font.c` missing from firmware CMakeLists (was in simulator only), format specifier mismatches (`%d` → `PRId32`), unused variable/function warnings, and `snprintf` truncation warning.
- **Firmware memory constraints** — ESP32-C6 has no PSRAM (corrected from CLAUDE.md which incorrectly stated 4MB). Removed bogus PSRAM settings from `sdkconfig.defaults`. Sprite cropping + RGB565A8 format ensures multi-session display fits in ~200 KB free internal SRAM.
- **Simulator window resizing** — Replaced integer-step scaling (which left large black dead zones between scale jumps) with continuous float scaling that fills the window smoothly at any size.
- **Aspect ratio enforcement** — Window now locks to the native display aspect ratio (328:180) during resize, eliminating black letterbox bars. Drag direction is detected (horizontal, vertical, or corner) to adjust the correct axis.
- **LED border rendering** — Border now renders uniformly around the content by filling the entire window with the LED color and insetting the framebuffer, instead of computing separate border and content rects with rounding gaps.
- **Narrow mode walk suppression** — Walk animations correctly cancelled when entering narrow mode (notification cards visible).
- **Deferred reposition detection** — Position change detection fixed for post-burrowing repositioning.
- **HUD canvas cleanup** — HUD canvas properly cleared when hiding subagent counter.
- **BLE version reading** — `read_version` return type validated for mock compatibility in tests.
- **Bounds check for empty sessions** — `set_sessions` with empty session list handled safely.
- **BLE reconnection state sync** — Daemon now proactively reconnects when the BLE device drops and immediately syncs time, re-reads protocol version, and replays all active notifications and session state. Previously this only happened when a new hook call arrived.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Subagent tracking** — `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` hooks track active Claude Code subagents per session. Sessions with active subagents count as "working", preventing Clawd from sleeping during long-running agent tasks.
- **Auto-update hooks on startup** — Hooks are checked and updated automatically on app launch when outdated, removing the need for manual "Install Hooks" clicks after adding new hook types.
- **Daemon health monitoring** — Daemon thread exceptions are caught and logged. Periodic health check timer (30s) detects dead daemon and shows disconnected icon.
- **Orphaned sim process cleanup** — On startup, orphaned simulator processes on the listen port are identified by name and killed instead of silently connecting to them.
- **Session state persistence** — Session state saved atomically to `~/.clawd-tank/sessions.json` on structural changes (state transitions, subagent add/remove). Daemon loads saved state on startup with immediate stale eviction, so restarting the app preserves the correct animation.
- **Simulator logging** — Simulator stdout/stderr routed through Python logger to unified `clawd-tank.log` with `[clawd-tank.sim-process]` tag.
- **Build script** — `host/build.sh` automates static simulator build, py2app, binary bundling, and optional install (`--install`).
- **Version logging** — App version logged on startup for easier debugging.

### Changed

- **Building animation** — Updated sprite with improved visuals.
- **Version numbering on master** — Commit count now measured against `origin/master` (unpushed commits) instead of local `master` (always 0).
- **CI workflow** — `build-macos-app.yml` now builds the static simulator and bundles it into the `.app`, matching `release.yml`.

### Fixed

- **Quit handler race condition** — Sim transport is now removed from daemon before killing the process, avoiding double-disconnect. Sim process is SIGKILL'd immediately instead of waiting 3s for SIGTERM.
- **Session file double-close** — Fixed fd double-close in `save_sessions` error path that could leave orphaned temp files.
- **Test pollution** — Added `conftest.py` with autouse fixture to redirect session persistence to temp dirs, preventing tests from writing to real `~/.clawd-tank/sessions.json`.
- **Stale subagent eviction** — Sessions with dead subagents (missed `SubagentStop` hooks) are now evicted normally by staleness checker, since active subagents keep `last_event` fresh via tool call hooks.
- **Stale launchd plist** — Auto-migrates the Launch at Login plist when it points to a different executable, instead of warning the user to manually re-enable.
- **Display state sync** — `_last_display_state` updated after transport replay to prevent duplicate broadcasts.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Session-aware working animations** — Clawd now shows real-time animation states driven by Claude Code session hooks. The tank acts as a workload meter reflecting what Claude is doing across all active sessions.
- **6 new sprite animations** — thinking (tapping chin with thought bubble), typing (frantic keyboard work), juggling (tossing data packets), building (hammering on anvil), confused (looking around with question marks), sweeping (push broom, oneshot for context compaction).
- **Intensity tiers** — Animation scales with concurrent session count: 1 session working = typing, 2 sessions = juggling, 3+ sessions = building.
- **Session state tracking** — Daemon maintains per-session state (`registered → thinking → working → idle → confused`) and computes a single display state via priority resolution.
- **3 new Claude Code hooks** — `SessionStart`, `PreToolUse`, `PreCompact` registered alongside existing hooks.
- **`set_status` BLE/TCP action** — New protocol command for daemon to control device animation state directly.
- **Fallback animation mechanism** — Oneshot animations (alert, happy, sweeping) now return to the current working animation instead of always idle.
- **Simulator `--pinned` flag** — Keeps the window always on top of other windows.
- **Simulator auto-focus** — Window comes to the front on launch.
- **Hook migration detection** — Install button detects outdated hooks and allows reinstallation.

### Changed

- **Sleep model** — Replaced firmware timer-based sleep (5-minute idle) with daemon-driven session-based sleep. No sessions = sleeping. Configurable staleness timeout (default 10 minutes) evicts dead sessions.
- **"Sleep Timeout" → "Session Timeout"** — Menu bar label renamed to reflect new semantics.
- **Default simulator scale** — Changed from 3x to 2x (640×344 window).
- **Clock display** — Now visible in all full-width states (idle, thinking, working), not just idle.
- **`daemon_message_to_ble_payload()`** — Returns `Optional[str]` instead of `str`; session-internal events return `None`.

### Fixed

- **Simulator shutdown freeze** — Fixed hang on exit when a TCP client was connected by closing the client socket during shutdown.
- **Hook reinstallation blocked** — `are_hooks_installed()` now checks all required hooks are present, not just that any hook uses the script.
